  Abstract                 = {This volume, which is a follow-up to BIS Policy Paper No 3 (January 1998), analyses the major changes in monetary policy transmission in the emerging market economies (EMEs) over the past decade and highlights a number of implications. It is based on two days of discussions among senior central bankers at a meeting at the BIS in December 2006. Fiscal dominance has been largely overcome and monetary policy frameworks are now more credible. The overview paper finds that central banks have become more flexible in their operations. The interest rate channels of monetary policy have become much stronger, and the relative importance of some of the traditional channels such as the credit channel has declined, at least in normal times. Better monetary policies have resulted in lower and less volatile inflation in most EMEs. An analysis of the transmission of monetary policy to longterm interest rates notes that the impact of the policy rates on long-term rates has been moderated by more stable inflation expectations, which has allowed central banks to be less aggressive in adjusting policies. External factors appear to be exerting an increasing influence on domestic long-term rates. A related analysis finds that greater globalisation has resulted in domestic short-term rates being significantly affected by foreign interest rates, particularly in countries with high capital mobility and with managed exchange rates. Finally, the pass-through from exchange rate changes to domestic inflation has fallen since 2001, while the sensitivity of inflation to foreign price changes has increased.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reports estimates of monetary policy reaction functions for two sets of countries: the G3 (Germany, Japan and the United States) and the E3 (France, Italy and the United Kingdom). It finds that since 1979 each of the G3 central banks has pursued an implicit form of inflation targeting, which may account for the broad success of monetary policy in those countries over this time period. The evidence also suggests that these central banks have been forward looking: they respond to anticipated inflation as opposed to lagged inflation. As for the E3, even prior to the emergence of the ‘hard ERM’, the E3 central banks were heavily influenced by German monetary policy. Further, using the Bundesbank’s policy rule as a benchmark, we find that at the time of the EMS collapse, interest rates in each of the E3 countries were much higher than domestic macroeconomic conditions warranted. Taken all together, the results lend support to the view that some form of inflation targeting may be superior to fixing exchange rates, as a means of gaining a nominal anchor for monetary policy.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)}

  Abstract                 = {This paper explores theoretically and empirically the view that Taylor rules are often nonlinear due to asymmetric central bank preferences, and that the nature of these asymmetries changes across different policy regimes. The theoretical model uses a standard new Keynesian framework to establish equivalence relations between the shape of nonlinearities in Taylor rules and asymmetries in monetary policy objectives. These relations are estimated and tested for the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) over various subperiods by means of smooth transition regressions.There is often evidence in favor of nonlinear rules in both countries, and their character changes substantially over subperiods. The period preceding inflation targeting in the UK is characterized by a concave rule supporting dominant recession avoidance preferences, while the inflation targeting period is characterized by a convex rule supporting dominant inflation avoidance preferences on the part of policymakers. Dominant inflation avoidance appears during the Vietnam War in the US while, during the Burns/Miller and the Greenspan periods, recession avoidance dominates. Under Volcker the Taylor rule is linear. This is consistent with an offset by inflation avoidance of the more prevalent recession avoidance of the Fed.Findings from both countries support the view that reaction functions and the asymmetry properties of the underlying loss functions change in line with the regime and the main macroeconomic problem of the day.}

  Abstract                 = {Modern theory has delivered both the conservative central banker and the principal-agent approaches as rationales for the independence of the central bank. The principal-agent approach directs attention to the importance of both clearly defining the goals of the central bank and its command in order to meet the targets assigned to it. The empirical evidence shows not only that greater independence is associated with lower inflation, but also that the central bank's rights not to finance the government and to set interest rates independently increase its effectiveness. The role of inflation targeting and the distinction between price level and inflation targeting are also analyzed.}

Such changes are not surprising given compositional changes in the Federal Open Market Committee, and we consider three subsamples delineated by the terms of recent fed Chairmen. We find that the estimated reaction functions for each period vary in ways that seem broadly consistent with the success or failure during the period at controlling inflation. These results suggest that a Taylor-rule framework is a useful way to summarize key elements of monetary policy.},
